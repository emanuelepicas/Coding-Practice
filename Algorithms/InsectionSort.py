Question: Implement insertion sort to sort an array in ascending order.
Visual explanation of how insertion sort works on array [5,2,4,1,3]:

Initial: [5,2,4,1,3]

Step 1: [2,5,4,1,3]  # 2 is inserted before 5
Step 2: [2,4,5,1,3]  # 4 is inserted between 2 and 5
Step 3: [1,2,4,5,3]  # 1 is inserted at the beginning
Step 4: [1,2,3,4,5]  # 3 is inserted between 2 and 4
